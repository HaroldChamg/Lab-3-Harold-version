library(tidyverse)

cdc <- as_tibble(cdc)
```

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F, eval = F}
#Smoking ratio by gender
ggplot(data = cdc) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = smoke100, fill = gender))+
  ggtitle('Smoking Males vs Female') +       
  xlab('0 = No, 1 = Yes')

I chose these two variables becuase I thought it would be intersting to see what the spread was. I did the graph the way I did becuase I thought it was easy to see the difference between smokers in male and females. It is easy to read and to understand what the graph it showing.
